# ExoplanetsClassifier
This is my first practical work for the ML class at UFMG.

The specification (portuguese) is in the specs.pdf file. All work done is in the jupyter-notebook (portuguese).

Basically, I had to test multiple classification models with hyperparameter tuning. The dataset is an Exoplanets dataset from NASA. It's link is on the jupyter-notebook.
